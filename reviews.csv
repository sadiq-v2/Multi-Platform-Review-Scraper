Yvonne Buhrmann,ID,2024-09-13T01:51:51.000Z,"We have insurance at Heymondo and want to upgrade. But getting hold of someone that can properly help us seems impossible. All the people that we have contacted does not really know the answers or repeats the same clauses as 'answers' to our questions. Not sure if we want to get a new policy with this company. If it is this difficult to get information, how difficult is it going to be to actually get covered when an emergency happens.Update: They got back to me with something of a 'final answer' in which they repeated exactly the same as before, not answering my question all. They just added that we should contact Iris Global directly for any further questions. Needless to say, we will not contact anyone further and will defintely not use Heymondo ever again. I'm certain they will evade claims the same way as they evade questions about their cover.Update:After writing this review they came back to me with a mail with a clear answer. So not all bad - but it's a pitty it had to go to these extremes.",2,No one can actually help you or knows whats going on

However, the true caliber of any person or company can be measured in their ability to fulfill any promise or obligation.  After actually filing a claim, I‚Äôve discovered that Heymondo is all slick and shiny but basically just another insurance company who relies on deceitful and utter useless partners such as ACI and STARR.  I went on a 7 day cruise from Seattle to Alaska while my luggage went to Detroit.  Returning home, I filed a claim {80071875} on May 23, 2024 for just over $500.00 and obtained a notice indicating the documentation and receipts were ‚Äúwell received‚Äù.  On June 14, 2024 I contacted ACI to learn the case had been closed and then reached out to STARR who  was ‚Äújust about‚Äù to mail a letter asking for additional information.  Specifically, they were satisfied with the receipts but wanted verification that no other carrier paid on the claim.  I‚Äôve completed their documentation, answered their questions and continue to jump thru the hoops they throw out to stall and delay.

Alberto,ES,2024-04-02T14:34:10.000Z,"Thanks for your answer and updates.It really shows how your company operates that the reason I'm not covered by your insurance is because my dad got sick 2 days before our trip started. If it had happened right at the airport, then the insurance would have kicked in. So, now I get that I paid for insurance that was basically canceled before we even took off. You didn‚Äôt provide any service but still took my money. The least you could do is give me my money back since I got nothing out of this. It feels like a scam. You should probably stop offering coverage for family illness or accidents since it only seems to apply when it suits you. Best regards.Heymondo the phantom coverage. I got an insurance travel with this company and exactly 2 days before departing my father who is an elderly was hospitalised for 7 days.

I'll keep you updated on the evolution of things.UPDATE 14 MARCH 2024:On Monday, March 11, 2024, I managed to get in touch with them. I went to the resort's clinic at my own expense, and my expenses will be settled based on the documents received from the doctor and the resort. At least I hope so :) I recommend this insurance only to those who don't get sick on Sunday... :))P.S. I'm fine now... :)",4,I accidentally hit my left little toe

amichellethotmail.com,CA,2024-05-01T19:01:17.000Z,"Beware of Heymondo Insurance and its parent company Iris Global! My experience with them has been nothing short of a nightmare. I purchased insurance in November 2023, thinking I was securing peace of mind for my trip. Little did I know, I was actually signing up for a rollercoaster ride of incompetence, deception, and outright theft.During my trip, I found myself very sick and requiring hospitalization. But the scariest part was the abysmal customer service I received from Heymondo and Iris Global thereafter. It's like they have a rotating door for their email responses‚Äîevery time I reached out, I got a different person, none of whom seemed to be able to provide me with any an answers.They have been feeding me lies upon lies, claiming to have paid over $75,000 in medical expenses without providing a shred of evidence. When I attempted to verify these payments with the hospital and flight company, surprise, surprise‚Äîno record of such payments existed. And let's not even get started on the coverage for companion expenses, which they conveniently haven‚Äôt paid despite my relentless provision of receipts.Let me make this crystal clear: Heymondo and Iris Global are fraudulent entities, preying on unsuspecting customers like myself. They will gladly take your hard-earned money and leave you high and dry when you need them the most. This is not just incompetence; this is outright theft.Save yourself the agony and financial ruin‚ÄîDO NOT, under any circumstances, buy insurance from these crooks. Spread the word far and wide; warn everyone you know. I refuse to believe that there's a single positive review out there that isn't fabricated by Heymondo and Iris Global themselves.As for Heymondo and Iris Global, I hope you're reading this. Your despicable conduct has not gone unnoticed. I will not rest until your true nature as thieves and scammers is exposed. Shame on you.",1,BEWARE of THIEVES Heymondo Insurance

Robert James,GB,2024-02-14T01:27:23.000Z,"I have had a number of policies over the years with Heymondo and most of my experiences with them have been worrisome.  In looking at the reviews below, I notice that the majority of the positive comments relate to the purchasing of the travel policy - at which Heymondo does an admittedly good job - but there seem to be quite a number of negative posts about the claims process and which, after all, should be the preeminent consideration of any traveler. Putting the missives of 'haters' aside, I believe that the concern is legitimate considering 1. it is literally impossible to get anybody from Heymondo on a call; 2. the Heymondo policy is subject to Spanish law (which might be problematic for many travelers) and 3. in the case of British travelers, my impression is that the Heymondo policy is not subject to the oversight of the UK's Financial Conduct Authority. As mentioned above, best that buyers be aware and carefully comparison shop.FURTHER UPDATE:In reply to Heymondo's reply, in my experience I have never been able to get anyone from Heymondo on a call and I am happy to stand corrected. That said, in the case of a dispute, the fact that the policy is subject to Spanish law - regardless of the residence of the policyholder - is an important point for buyers as is the fact that British policyholders do not benefit from FCA oversight. I believe that both these points are true statements and should be flagged to potential purchasers.",2,Buyer Beware!

Kelly,US,2024-07-18T19:00:15.000Z,"UPDATED July 18This experience working through the claim is just as horrendous as I anticipated!One month later and more broken promises (claim reps promising to call back and never calling).  Requests for more and more ""documentation"" on both claims is asinine.  I respond to a request (in snail mail letters!), then another letter comes asking for more information, some of which I've already provided.  The response to this complaint is - as the rest of the experience has been - completely worthless!  NO ONE has contacted me personally about my complaints - only to send canned words that have done nothing to help actually process my claims._____________HORRIBLE experience with this company!I purchased a Heymondo travel insurance policy for myself and my husband for a 2 week trip to Indonesia and Thailand.We both became ill and needed a doctor's services while in Thailand, and I needed to submit a two medical claims (one for my husband and one for myself).  Here's what's happened so far:In the app, there's a customer service chat.  Don't let that fool you - it's a bot.  And the chat is only monitored on weekdays.  Any previous chat histories aren't saved or shown in the app, which gives you no communication summary - red flag!  The claim forms should be easy to download from the app - but there are no claim forms there.  Again - red flag!So, I submitted a message to ask where to find claim forms.  Didn't hear back for 2 days.When I did hear back, it was from an unrecognized email addres (acipta) and stated I would hear back from someone else with a specific e-mail address.  I never heard back after two more days so sent another message.Didn't hear anything.  So, I called the ""get help anytime"" phone number inside the app.  My country is set to U.S.  The first two phone prompts were in English.  Then, the prompts suddenly switched solely to Spanish and I couldn't understand any of the prompts.  I was connected to an agent that spoke no English, provided no help, so I was forced to hang up.  Tried calling again, thinking it was a glitch, but again was dumped into a Spanish speaking queue.After more back and forth in email, I FINALLY obtained the medical claim forms.  They not labeled Heymondo OR Clements (who I purchased the policy from).  Two MORE company names are listed ACI, and Starr.  So now we have four different entities in the background - making for a very confusing experience.  WHO Is actually responsible for client experience here?  After filling out the forms, I looked at the instructions for how to submit the claims.The form says ""for fastest service, upload the required document to our secure website....with website URL.However, when I go to that site, it's a general corporate website.  There are logins for ""member"" and ""client.""  No idea which one I am.  Both require a member ID (which I don't have - was only given a policy # from Heymondo).  So then there's another little obscure phrase that you have to e-mail client access to GET a user ID and password.  So I sent that e-mail - no doubt unmonitored on the weekend.  No mention at all of Heymondo, where I purchased the policy.I have NO FAITH in the legitimacy of this company if I can't even file a simple claim.  I can only imagine the experience ahead of me to get the claims approved.",1,HORRIBLE experience with this company!

On the website as you're working your way through the purchase, the information on screen isn't very clear and leaves you with questions, e.g. are the cover limits per person? How do you increase electrical cover to 100% of the baggage? Is it 50% by default or do you have to add that too? Etc. However customer service are very helpful and quick to respond and they clarified everything for us, allowing us to continue to buy the policy.

Heymondo customer service is kind and responsive until a refund claim is submitted, then their fraudulent insurance provider pays a simbolic amount, far from fulfilling the coverage agreed by contract, and both become totally unresponsive.I subscribed witha friend a travel insurance policy with Heymondo for a trip to Indonesia and Thailand. One day our boat to Bali from Lombok-Gili T was cancelled last minute due to bad weather. We had a flight Bali-Bangkok to catch and our last flight Bangkok-Vienna. We contacted Heymondo and they said we had ""Travel delay due to transport 1.500 ‚Ç¨"" and ""Missed connecting flight 1.000 ‚Ç¨"". There was no way to reach Bali, but we had a flight Lombok-Bangkok which was also the cheapest solution to avoid missing the subsequent flight. This resulted in 874‚Ç¨ expenses, 432‚Ç¨ each.Here the problems began: I had to contact multiple times Heymondo and Iris Global, the insurance service supplier, before they finally processed my claim after more than 60 days (against the set 20-30 days).

We stayed in a 1 Star and only had Uber rides, not much. It is the principle of the thing we are disappointed in;  the company is not honoring what the rep said NOR the insurance. How is it possible we won‚Äôt be reimburse? It was not anything we could have prevented ourselves. They should pay door to door on flight disruptions. Plus, no calls allowed, only email once trip is over so we sit around waiting for months with back and forth. Pay the extra expenses.

It took several emails to Hey Mondo and their contracted insurance company IRIS global (who are terrible) to receive my refund.I will highlight I sent blood tests, receipts, doctors prescriptions, contact details of doctors and STILL had to rebook a doctor appointment for the doctor to type a small paragraph to get my refund. I then realised they underpaid me 400 Euro and I once again had resend the same information.I appreciate I got my money eventually, however you MUST be switched on to email, and literally fight for your money back and honestly it was extremely stressful! As a side note IRIS global the company HeyMondo work with are terrible and should be called out for their terrible terrible customer service.Addit reply: The doctor did not write a report, my doctor literally wrote 4 sentences, stating less information then my blood work report. Sorry but it was definitely a way for HeyMondo or Iris to get out of paying a claim unless people really wanted it.The 400 euro missing was a way to see if I would notice something wasn't paid out, because no one told me something was not paid until I did the math and asked for a breakdown of the recipt.Like I said it was paid- but with a lot of hassle, stress, many emails, and loops to jump through.

Truncate their surname (a double one and therefore longer than 20 characters) with the risk of having a beneficiary with a surname different from the real one included in the contract? Who knows!This alone - for a company that operates exclusively online - is somewhat perplexing. How can you establish in 2023 such a property (only 20 characters!!) for a form-field that must contain someone‚Äôs surname, whereas in Europe there are not a few with the double surname?! Therefore, the thing is totally meaningless (a mistake all the more unforgivable for a company born in Spain).But what seems even more senseless (especially in summer) is to limit technical assistance (of which there is no telephone ""version"") to weekdays only, so, being today Saturday, I will have to wait until Monday in the hope that someone responds to the email I sent to report the technical problem that does not allow me to complete the operation (in the sense that I do not want to enter personal data trunks and therefore inaccurate). I therefore await news in the hope that the continuation of my experience with Heymondo may know better times.Update:On Monday they solved the issue!",5,brief PDF file

Arthur,US,2023-07-26T03:25:52.000Z,"I purchased a Heymondo medical policy for a trip to the US and unfortunately I had to make a claim after waking up one morning with serious abdominal pain.About one hour after calling Heymondo and being put in touch with their US consultant, I was sent to an urgent care center not far from where I was staying. Heymondo took care of the bill directly, although the process was a bit unusual: I had to give the urgent care center the phone number for Heymondo, and then Heymondo gave the clinic their credit card information over the phone. Unfortunately, urgent care referred me to the ER for imaging. After submitting the referral and other paperwork to Heymondo (including a copy of my plane ticket to verify the dates of my trip), it took about an hour and a half for Heymondo to provide me with authorization to go to the ER of my choice. I was given a claim code from the American insurer Aetna, which meant that I didn't have to put the ER charge on my credit card and then make a claim later. I was then prescribed an antibiotic, which I made a separate claim for and I was reimbursed the following business day.Overall, this was a pretty positive experience and I don't have any serious complaints. The biggest frustration is that over the course of the day I dealt with 3 or 4 different 'consultants' but the benefit here is that the process was outsourced to an office familiar with healthcare in the US. Many of the emails I received - including the initial message which told me which urgent care center to visit - were in Spanish, but google translate took care of that.I am quite pleased with how everything worked out and I will definitely continue to use Heymondo for travel insurance.",5,Clear and Easy

Andreliz,PR,2023-07-02T18:37:12.000Z,"My experience with Heymondo was wonderful during the purchase process for travel insurance. They were very helpful and friendly, informative and timely in following up with me with answers to any questions. This is the ONLY reason I am giving them a 2-star review. Unfortunately we had to file a claim with the insurance company, Iris Global, so all communication then switches from Heymondo to Iris Global. Let the nightmare begin. Upon filing the claim I spoke with a Heymondo representative who was most helpful and sympathetic due to the circumstances of my mother passing away. I have never spoken with anyone from Iris Global, only communication is via email. I have been asked for multiple documents and receipts and proof of payment for our trip - all of which were submitted to their satisfaction. After reviewing these documents I am informed nothing submitted is covered stating the reason is the trip had already started when the claim was filed - which was a few hours into day one. The excuse of ‚Äútrip cancellation‚Äù no longer valid is ridiculous as the trip was with Avalon Fishing started in 2 days. This would be the most costly part of the reimbursement so it did not surprise me when I was asked for more documentation regarding this part of the claim. But then to still be denied only makes me more suspicious they were looking for some kind of ‚Äúloop hole‚Äù to get out of reimbursement. And if trip cancellation does not apply why doesn‚Äôt trip interruption apply? This is clearly listed in the policy coverage. I am frustrated with the difficulty communicating with someone other than email and have requested to speak with someone via phone several times now. I reached out to Heymondo in a desperate attempt for assistance and did receive an immediate response which I do appreciate but unfortunately this does not really help when dealing with a claim. I will say Heymondo initially followed up with me when the claim was first submitted just to check in as a courtesy and they have always been timely in responding to me but they are not able to do anything more during the claim process as I have been told. Heymondo - the insurance policy with Iris Global is apparently useless and your partnership with Iris Global should be re-examined in my opinion. It is night and day in customer service and communication but most importantly they are not honoring the insurance policy you are selling which should be a concern. Nobody wants to make a claim for a planned trip especially for the reason of your mother passing away and if you should have to it shouldn‚Äôt be an ongoing nightmare as this has been while grieving the loss of my mother. You buy trip insurance for reassurance and security if something were to happen and hope you never have to submit a claim. This has been the worst experience in submitting a claim and this includes Hurricane Florence claim while living in Wilmington, NC. I would not recommend purchasing a policy with Heymondo simply because of Iris Global - no matter how nice and helpful the representative is to you.",5,Great prices for insurance and reliable

SeattleSonya,US,2023-06-26T00:19:24.000Z,"An edit to the previous review of mine:Heymondo worked to solve this problem with wonderful efficiency. Their customer service support was top notch. The issue was mostly resolved and what wasn't was just due to the fact that the policy wording couldn't cover the specifics of the claim as it was a case of negligence on the part of the airline. However, Heymondo went above and beyond here and restored my confidence with them. The company (Iris Global) that they brokered with for the claim left a bit to be desired in their communication skills but Heymondo interceded beautifully.So what is the point of an insurance policy with HeyMondo if they won't cover a claim of:1. Denied Boarding2. Arrival 1 day late3. Arrival to wrong cityI received an email 3 weeks after my claim simply saying that having looked at my policy my claim is not covered and no other explanation. But I would think that these items would be quite typical claims on travel insurance, wouldn't they? Despite my having provided exhaustive paperwork, they won't elaborate on what reasons they have to deny my coverage or what part of the policy prevents this claim. Maybe if their customer service team actually laid out their reasoning I'd listen but when the airline refuses to compensate a passenger for denied boarding, won't cover their hotel and doesn't get them back home for another day that's usually when travel insurance should kick in, isn't it? And if somehow not covering denied boarding, late arrival and arrival to the wrong airport is in the policy then maybe HeyMondo's insurance isn't all it's cracked up to be. I have another 10 months to go on my 1 year policy but have a feeling I may as well be traveling without insurance after my experience with them.I did give them 2 stars though instead of 1 because of their sleek-looking app. It was a nice veneer to the service that was actually offered.",4,Easy to use website

Why not make another tier to cover this, if I ever go skiing I would need to buy additional insurance which makes this less attractive and if I have more time to research my next purchase might be from a competitor because of this.Please also create a normal customer portal with email/address to access policies.

I had 2 small claims over the past year & both were DENIED after a very long process (6-8 weeks) of providing all the documentation & receipts to support my claims. They even asked for my bank acct. info and then after much waiting, denied my claims. If I can spare one person with this review, I hope you take my warning!! Waste of time and money! I‚Äôm going with a reputable company now, Allianz!! Good riddance Heymondo! You failed me not once, but twice!UPDATE: to save face, now Heymondo is reaching out? Please. After stringing me along after my 28 HOUR flight delay in Apr 2022 and not paying anything, not even my 1 night hotel stay, and after 6/8 weeks declining my claim for a 24 hr delay for my cruise departure in Nov. 2022, again hotel & expenses denied!! Words are cheap. I got zero when I THOUGHT I had travel insurance!I find it ridiculous that so many reviewers are giving good ratings after they buy the policy!

After you purchase the policy, you can see the ‚Äúparticular conditions‚Äù which divides that $450 into $50 per 12 hrs. There is nowhere that breaks that amount down on the website. And if you‚Äôre delayed anything past 12 hrs, you need to spend the night and $50 will not cover all that cost. And the customer service is terrible and takes a long time to get back to you.

Alan,NA,2023-04-06T13:23:05.000Z,"Hilariously bad experience. First I spoke to them on the phone. It was a Sunday and told me the claims team doesn't work on a Sunday, only working hours Mon-Fri. So if you've read it's 24/7, that's not the case.Then I was asked to send me details to my case 4 times. The same documents with the same information. When I tell them they already have it, I've already sent it, then they find it - so it's comically disorganied.Now I've had my claim sitting there with no response from Heymondo or AXA. I don't get acknowledgement of receipt or that they're even looking into it. Has been over a month. I imagine they're trying to make getting a claim as difficult as possible so that I either get frustrated or forget.I will definitely be cancelling my insurance and I would NOT recommend them at all to anyone.",3,Long time Heymondo customer and‚Ä¶

However, when it comes to paying your claim, they don‚Äôt pay. I have a simple and low value claim for a dental emergency. I opened the claim as per their guidance. They failed to do any work on it until I start chasing. Being just a single intervention and having all the proof needed it was not much they could ask me for. So the claim was approved (again, only after I started chasing). Once approved, the term is for them to transfer the funds within 7 days. It‚Äôs now one month later and still no refund. I am calling them and all I am told is that it‚Äôs with finance department and I need to wait. Absolutely disgusting!!They also have a large excess fee, so you will probably end up paying for all the treatment yourself, unless you have a serious illness that requires hospitalisation.Better look somewhere else.UPDATEA heymondo representative contacted me after I left this review and sorted out the issue.

Valid,US,2023-03-12T15:11:44.000Z,"Absolutely horrific - stay far away. You will die before they approve you to go anywhere but an urgent care. Forget it if you need an ambulance or ER. If you don't get a pre approval for medical assistance and then wait for them to let you know which ER you can go to, it is extremely unlikely you will be reimbursed. So if it's a life threatening situation, you're in trouble. Can't reimburse after the fact either, you need that pre-approval or nothing. And they pick the provider. And even if you have a specialist referral, they'll still try and send you back to an urgent care. And as far as reimbursement goes, they pick and choose what they will refund. Not once when they assured me they had given the urgent care their payment details and I wouldn't need to pay, were the payment details actually there. I had to pay all out of pocket. No security, it was a terrifying, demoralising experience. Don't touch this insurance company.EDIT: no one can fault the SALES customer service. While buying your policy or leaving a bad review they are quick and efficient getting back to you. But this is not the case once you actually need the insurance. And despite their response, it is absolutely not true that you will be reimbursed after the fact - the insurance company categorically said that I had to call first. I mentioned I had gone to urgent care previously and they said it was too late. And later I needed a particular kind of doctor in an urgent situation, however in the States, urgent care won‚Äôt deal with that kind of issue - but I couldn‚Äôt even face dealing with Hey Mondo again that I paid everything out of pocket for the rest of the trip. So don‚Äôt let these quick responses to your review fool you. They are terrible once you actually need them.",5,Easy to manage. Very affordable.

Terrible customer service, potential fraud activity, outsourcing their business, amongst other dodgy activity. The insurance you purchase isn't even from heymondo they handball all responsibility to a Spanish company called IRIS so this makes the process even longer and more complicated as heymondo don't communicate with them they make you email IRIS yourself and deal with them. They finally gave me a contact number for them but they speak Spanish so again another ridiculous roadblock you have to face. None of this IRIS stuff is stated when you sign up with heymondo, I would say its borderline illegal to not clearly inform your customers of this before signing up. It is honestly the most ridiculous business model I have ever seen or heard of there needs to be a massive independent review into this company.They constantly take weeks and even months to reply to basic emails when you ask questions about a claim. If I didn't send multiple follow up emails they would never respond, I had to continually send emails to finally get a response. Even the claims take months to be resolved on simple things. There is no contact number that you can call after your insurance policy ends. So you have 24/7 access to call them during your insurance dates but afterwards you cannot contact them unless its through email which they take months to respond. FYI heymondo, good idea to have a contact number post policy as 95% of customers will submit claims when they arrive home from a holiday. heymondo probably do this to make it difficult for everyone. You sign an insurance policy with heymondo expecting to receive insurance from them but they outsource everything, which is borderline fraud I would think.Buyers beware this company also doesn't cover pick pocket theft, they must be the only travel insurance company in the world that doesn't. I had my phone pick pocketed but they refused to cover it as ""an object wasn't forced from a human with violence"" hahaha what a joke. There was nothing in their policy that states they don't cover this either so this will be taken further. If you read other reviews on here you can see the amount of people that are lawyering up and taking this company to court. I wish these reviews were available before I purchased with them.I could go on all day about this company but please anyone reading do not purchase insurance with this company it is the worst thing I have ever done. I signed with them as it was slightly cheaper but it is not worth the hassle at all as they don't cover anything and their customer service is non existent.EDIT after Reply:If you write a bad review on heymondo they will reply instantly but if you submit a claim or have any type of query about your insurance they take weeks to reply to a simple email. This shows you exactly how this company operates, disgraceful.And my case has been reviewed already, I am not going through that process again I have had enough of dealing with the incompetence of your business.SECOND REPLY:As I have stated above, my case has been reviewed already twice.

One doctor said she could not help.  Another one replied in Spanish which we couldn't understand.  There were no instructions given on where he could go, or how he could go to any doctor and get reimbursement.  I later called the 24hr helpline on the app, and the person required me to send my policy document as proof.  Quoting my policy number was not sufficient.  He later replied me an email, giving me a website and username and password, to tell me to submit my claims there.Separately I emailed customer service to ask arbitrarily if I had a broken leg now, which hospital could I go to, the customer service Myriam said she could not reveal the list of hospital and asked me to go to the app for help.I find this not helpful as all, as we are being directed to many places.

Customer,US,2023-02-13T17:42:44.000Z,"The positive reviews have been from people who were lured by the reasonably low travel insurance price and gimmicky website and app. The negative reviews are from people like me who processed a claim and have been waiting for almost 4 months to get my claim reimbursed! 4 months!!! It first starts out with no one responding to your emails. Then when you find an email (to IRIS GLOBAL in Madrid) that will actually respond back to you, they‚Äôll tell you your claim has been ‚Äúprocessed‚Äù and should ‚Äúreceive it in a week‚Äù. That week comes and passes. No reimbursement! I‚Äôm forced to make this negative review with the hopes of getting MY money paid back to me immediately!  4 months I‚Äôve been waiting!! And I will continue to wait and provide negative reviews on all travel insurance platforms I can find until I get MY money!  Don‚Äôt be fooled by their low prices. Get a reputable travel insurance company even if they cost more because you want efficient and honest service when you have to file a claim. You definitely get what you pay for!Update 10/24/22:I just got a reply from Heymondo suggesting I contact them via email. Guess what? I already did last week? And guess what? NO REPLY!!! Not a surprise!!Update: 10/25/22Ive finally received an email from Heymondo saying Iris Global (the mother company) will be contacting me.  I have yet to be contacted!  It‚Äôs amusing that Iris Global is the company I first emailed and was told my claim had been approved and my reimbursement was on its way. Now Heymondo says they are deferring to Iris Global!  No one is taking responsibility!  By the way, I‚Äôve left messages (2 actually) on their WhatsApp number. Ana it has been unanswered!  How much more of this will occur before I get my claim reimbursed??? I have never experienced such bad customer service ever!Update: 10/30/2022Still no action on my claim except the same reply from Heymondo that they‚Äôve forwarded my ‚Äúinquiry‚Äù to IRIS GLOBAL. I‚Äôve heard this before and it‚Äôs a stalling tactic. Its essentially telling me to ‚Äú shut up‚Äù. Well I won‚Äôt. It‚Äôs been 4 months and I‚Äôll keep at it even if it takes a year! We‚Äôre not talking about a few hundred dollars. We‚Äôre talking  about a claim over $5,000. If I have to find a lawyer in Spain to represent me I‚Äôll do it.Update: 11/9/2022I was finally contacted by Vanessa of Heymondo on 10/31/22. She was profusely apologetic for my experience. Well had this type of follow up been done sooner I may have been more understanding.  The reimbursement is being processed as of 11/4. Here‚Äôs the catch - I noticed the amount on their transfer receipt is short $700+ dollars! They didn‚Äôt calculate my reimbursable hotel expenses correctly!

So my luggage was lost and I had to buy some clothes from a retailer by the train station who only gave me a credit card receipt and not an itemized invoice.  The retailer was not sophisticated enough to provide itemized invoices, it was a random shop near the Termini train station and I had to get clothes in a hurry because I had just flown for 24 hours and had no new undergarments or shirts.  Also the airline never gave me a receipt for my luggage because I had to find it myself.  This company has refused to process my claim because I don't have an itemized invoice from the clothing retailer.   They keep asking for the receipt of the luggage and itemized invoice and I don't have either to give them.  DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY!   I even asked them for a refund of my insurance policy which I would be happy with at this point - I'm not even sure they will honor that.I filed a claim for delayed luggage and it's been more than a week and I still haven't heard back anything.

I had clear Covid case in Malaysia that my total claim was about $900 for hotel stay extension due to government imposed mandatory isolation. I had taxi fare to Covid test of $13 and positive covid test for $34. Heymondo did not pay the taxi cost despite my written, signed and sworn statement, due to the fact that Malaysian taxi driver had run out of receipts. Imagine, Heymondo took an effort not to pay $13 !! For the mandatory isolation accommodation and test Heymondo compensated only $460, which is half of the true-out-of the-pocket costs. The claims process took altogether 32 hours of work from me, and lasted almost a month. The customer service department does not handle the claims, but for that you are forwarded to this horrible outsourced company in Spain called AXA Assistance. AXA is just company created to make your life difficult and for insurance company to avoid compensating. They just make the claims process so difficult that you give up wasting your time. Heymondo requested me to EMAIL my passport copy and bank statement copy. I told them that EMAIL is not secure way of handling such private and financial data as passport copy and bank statement. I provided them with secure link to download the documents and they refused. I explained them that financial services act requires them to use secure means as secure email. I asked them to provide me with a secure way to deliver the documents, for which the claims department totally stopped responding to me for two weeks until I complained to Heymondo customer service department, which then activated AXA Assistance to reply again.I had still almost 10 months of my policy left, but I just told Heymondo to immediately cancel my policy. It is total waste of money and especially your time. They make it super easy for you to sign-up and have nice promises, certificates, and so on.

On uploading all necessary documents (COVID-19 diagnosis report from the doctor, cancellation confirmation from the airline, etc.), my claims case was active with Heymondo and their insurance partner AXA.The claim took approximately two weeks to process, during which I got satisfactory feedback through Heymondo's WhatsApp channel. Received my reimbursement without any hassles.Would totally recommend this insurance provider. Make sure you keep all documents at hand.",1,DO NOT BUY INSURANCE WITH THIS SCAM COMPANY
Terje Sten Olsen,NO,2022-12-04T11:55:54.000Z,"I had two very positive experiences online with my questions about Heymondo. The person responded within 24 hours- was polite with clear explanations. This is my first time using this company and have found the presentation extremely clear (cost, coverage types, exclusions). I will use them on my next trip",5,Easy to order and understand
Billy Kot,CA,2022-12-02T18:42:05.000Z,"Update 26/07/2022The heymond support team do help and consider my situation. So I can solve the problem and apply the coverage of policy.Thank you so much. I'll be able to prepare for the trip with peace of mind to you.P.S. When I'll end travel up, I'll reupdate the review. I wish every customer trip in comfort and safty :)------------------------This is unfair treatment. As the COVID-19 situation are getting worse, Heymondo changed their policy.I haven't started the trip yet. Nevertheless, they said they couldn't make typo corrections. My insurance was not covered due to a date misprint. So I request that I want to change the start date because of wrong letter. That's why I asked for a correction.However, Vanessa said it could not be modified. They told me to cancel my current contract and sign up for a new one. However, Heymondo is refusing to join Koreans. This is clearly racism. What can I do change the date? There is nothing I can do. Many people are harmed by their selfish policies. They force me to cancel.",1,Why are you restricting the Multiple‚Ä¶

Graeme Flint,GB,2022-11-29T16:43:43.000Z,"Great experience purchasing the travel insurance! Information well detailed, easy to compare all the options and buy, and I really loved having an app - it will for sure be more accessible in case we need to talk with heymondo during our trip (hopefully we won't! :) )Just 2 notes:1. It was confusing for me to have an heymondo.com and an heymondo.es with different coverage and quite different prices. I was not sure if I could buy through any of them - talked with the customer service and they answered the next business day, super quick and helpful, saying that I could buy using each one of them.2. When adding the surname, the field is limited to 20 characters, which means that for people with 3 or more surnames it is not possible to add all of them (in Portugal this is quite common to happen). In our case, I had to put all our names and surnames on the ""name"" field and only the last surname on the ""last name"" field.",5,Quick and very easy to purchase online

Estuardo,GT,2022-11-26T01:43:23.000Z,"Waste of money. Heymondo is just a middleman for other insurance company. In my case I was staying in Spain and when calling through the app, all the calls were immediately redirected to AXA Assistance customer support.Dealing with AXA was a pain. Not only they sent me to one of the worst rated clinics in the area, that was also very far from the place where I was staying. They also wanted to charge me 500 EUR for dental work that would cost 80 EUR if I payed it directly to the doctor. I had a budget of 300 EUR for dental expenses, so they wanted me to pay the difference of 200 EUR. The dental work was composed of several things, some of which I didn't need, they were included just to inflate the price. I therefore told the AXA that I just need one procedure from the list of procedures they sent me, so that I wouldn't have to pay anything extra. At that point they started to claim that such dental treatment is not covered by my insurance at all.I contacted Heymondo to try to resolve the situation. They of course didn't do anything with that. Completely useless, it would be exactly the same if I bought the insurance directly with AXA. Heymondo doesn't have any value added. They claim they have 24 hour live support chat in the app, however there's never anybody online in the chat. You just leave the message and they get back to you by email the next day.They also don't disclose anywhere on the site that they're just resellers of AXA Assistance. If I knew that I would've never bought their insurance.",5,Excellent Service!!!

customer,US,2022-08-19T20:22:41.000Z,"I purchased this after searching for months for travel insurance. I had a piece of damaged luggage when I returned home. I submitted all the documents except a PIR report ( which customer service said the insurance carriers might request) I received a response from the insurance saying because I didn't initially supply the PIR my case was closed, but if I got one it could be reopened. I went to the airport and got wgat they say is a report. Gave that information again to customer service and the insurance person. After several emails being bounced around no one from insurance is responding. Customer service says resend emails. Emails are bounced back as a failure to send. I can't imagine if there was a more urgent claim besides a damaged piece of luggage what would happen. Yes the purchase was fast and easy, cost was good and peace of mind but if you have a claim BEWARE! I will never buy this insurance again they are located in Spain which I didn't know. I'll by something from a US company. UPDATE: I send all my emails now to customerservice AND insurance. There is still no resolve 4 weeks later. At least I'm getting responses, but they  keep requestinga this PIR report. Which is different from what the airline gives me as a report. The 1 piece of documentation they want( out of the 12 photos already sent) is different I guess in Spain than what the USA airlines give you. The airline gave me 2 documentation in emails. Not good enough for them. That includes me driving to airport/contacting airlines by phone 3 times. I'm done UPDATE: well they finally acknowledged one of the 2 airline reports I've  sent( about 5 times) is correct. NOW they want another document which i have sent 3 times. They really are dropping the ball. At least I get a response everyday now, even though its redundant.Last UPDATE, So after months of back and forth they finally decide to pay me $50. BUT wanted my bank information to do a wire transfer. WHAT you think I'm going to give you my bank info after all this. The transfer costs me $15. So my net would be $35.  Then after going to the bank and all the paper worked involved I told them nevermind. Then they said we can give you the full $50 back on the credit card you bought the insurance on. Why go through all this. When you put a claim in with documentation, pay the people. That's why they buy insurance.",5,Easy application process.

James D,US,2022-06-20T20:48:34.000Z,I am traveling overseas for a years time. 4 months ago I went to the hospital and HeyMondo supposedly said they would pay up front and/or reimburse me if they didn‚Äôt pay upfront. We‚Äôll surprisingly they didn‚Äôt pay upfront because I didn‚Äôt give them 2 days time before I was rushed into the emergency room and they have yet to reimburse me a penny. They are using a janky international third party bank who Is struggling to wire the money. Since this process has been taking so long and they haven‚Äôt been very helpful I have had to switch travel insurances while abroad. HeyMondo seems legit at first until you actually need their help. Do NOT purchase their insurance!,5,"Easy, quick, and affordable"

And she did not understand what I have to say because she hummed at every word I said? When I told her ""Please listen to me and then talk so you can hear me"" she hanged up to me? Unbelievable.I called again, she was the one to answer me again, and she apologised  to me telling me that her english is not so good.

Nadia K,GB,2022-05-14T14:21:50.000Z,"The method of purchasing was easy. We purchased the Covid-19 coverage in the event that we tested positive for Covid and could not fly back to Canada. And unfortunately I tested negative and my husband positive. We called heymondo immediately and they opened up a claim and was helpful in the beginning. Then communications stopped. We did not hear from the agent for 7 days and counting. So we reached our patience level and I reached out to heymondo customer service via the app. A customer service rep wrote back after a day to request additional information. Now we are waiting to see what they could do for us.Heymondo customer service is really great. As promised, they followed up with their AXA partner and asked them to process my claim after I provided them with all documentation. They also noted the volume of claims being processed and provided a timeline (20-30) days.My advice is to call to open the claim but then send a message to the customer service team via the app/email so heymondo is aware.I would recommend to anyone who is travelling and needs a negative PcR test to get back into their country.",5,Excellent coverage
John McKaveney,US,2022-05-13T21:43:10.000Z,Very informative website and very east purchase process.  Hopefully this insurance is something we will no need on our trip but is is reassuring to know we have it if we do.,5,Quick

customer,QA,2022-04-16T10:21:48.000Z,Heymondo site was simple to use.  One suggestion to make it easier when reviewing exact coverage for each option would be for them to show the Covid-19 Insurance coverage as part of each plan if its covered.  You should not have to click on Covid-19 Insurance above the plans or scroll down to the bottom of the plan descriptions to see what is covered.Otherwise all good!,5,VERY QUICK POLICY ISSUANCE

Their resolution of these issues as well as many other questions and email exchanges quickly put our minds at ease.

It was very easy to buy.COVID travel problems turned my trip from 3 to 9 months, and Heymondo was able to extend my trip, and add additional countries to my policy quickly and easily throughout.

Monica Deslandes,ID,2022-02-27T03:47:06.000Z,"I can not recommend Heymondo's customer service enough! I needed to purchase travel insurance that included Covid-19 coverage (which some countries are now requiring) for a 4-month long remote work trip and saw Heymondo's Black Friday sale. The price was right on Premium for 2 people so I jumped on it, but forgot to add the Optional Electronics coverage, which I needed to cover my work computer and camera.This was my oversight, but I would suggest to double/triple check that you selected any Optional coverage for Electronics, Adventure Sports, and/or Cruise if you need it before checking out - the layout doesn't display your selection (or non-selection) again before you purchase.We might have been just OK with the 50% of baggage coverage versus the 100% that would fully cover our computers and cameras, but since we weren't leaving for another month and it would be for a longer stay, I figured I'd see if anything could be done.Giuseppe from Heymondo was the absolute best! He was super responsive and patient over the course of our interaction. He was thorough in explaining what I needed to do (I had to book another plan with my change before receiving a refund for the first) sent screenshots for instructions along the way, and still honored the Black Friday sale for my repurchase that included additional coverage.I quickly received my refund from the change. It came in 2 days - even faster than the expected 5 days. The whole process was easier than I thought it would be. Thank you, HeyMondo, for the peace of mind!Heymondo and Guiseppe have my highest recommendation!

It was super to signup for HeyMondo and give them our money, however, now that we are actually trying to make a claim the process has been drawn out and painful to the point that I can only assume it is by design in the hopes of us giving up.My wife needed emergency medial treatment 3 months ago while in the US for something minor (the bill was $400). The first part of the process was fine, but now that we are dealing with their insurance underwriters it has literally been 10 weeks of back and forth with them. They ask for information, we provide it and then they ask for different information (or in some cases the same information, again) - surely one would think they had this figured out by now. My wife and I are quite technically savvy but I don't know older or less familiar with technology would ever handle this.We have probably spent 10-15 hours on this, all for a seemingly small bill.

I appreciate Heymondo quick response.I recently purchased Hey Mondo travel insurance. On their website, it says that each traveller has $US 2,500 of coverage if testing positive for SARS-CoV-19 and subsequently quarantined.After purchasing the policy and reviewing the policy wording, there is no reference to this coverage. Indeed, s. 2.3 of the policy, ""Additional Expenses"", reads as if there is no coverage for this risk.I have twice contacted the company via WhatsApp for further details, without response.I am leaving next week and am deeply concerned that I don't have the coverage for which I purchased the policies. Do I actually have coverage for accommodation, food, etc. if I am put under quarantine during my trip? What are the terms of that coverage?It appears that Hey Mondo is advertising coverage on the website, inducing customers to purchase policies accordingly, but the actual policy wording does not offer this protection.",5,Very easy to use.

DAVID TINSON,GB,2022-01-27T16:51:06.000Z,"Since I moved to Thailand earlier this year, one of the requirements was to get an insurance. I signed up with HeyMondo hearing recommendations from a friend. There was no intention of using it until I got hospitalized  and had to use it.1) While it was fast to talk to Giuseppi. The whole process of claiming is a nightmare. The whole hospitalization was done so quickly I was not able to contact HeyMondo before I was admitted. But immediately after I was confined I reached out to HeyMondo. I was told that I can reimburse.2) So everything is settled now, but I am still waiting for my reimbursement. It's been 3 months now and I have never heard back from them.3) The medical team is making it seem like I had a chronic issue that I should be disqualified from the claim. I don't know how else to explain that this was the first time and I had doctors records to support it.4) Now I have not received news or update. They have passed me off to AXA and they have not helped.Do not get insurance from them. You don't need that extra hassle and inconvenience of proving yourself innocent.",5,Holiday insurance

Renewal is considerably cheaper than taking out a new policy.  I never got the email, and when I realised it was 'about that time' I checked, and was expired by a week.  I was travelling at the time thinking I was covered.  I did a full email file search (including 'junk' and 'deleted') for the reminder email - but there was none.  I called customer service and they said reminders were always sent, and maybe it had gone to 'junk'.  My search showed otherwise- in fact, I have a dedicated folder/file for HeyMondo.  I said given that I've been an ongoing customer who always renews the policy, and that the reminder never got to me, would they allow the renewal price as good will.  No.  So it cost me almost twice to take out a new policy.Ongoing issue is the phone app has never helped- not once in the last year has the customer service number been available ""try again later"" is all I have ever gotten.At present I have in a claim and I've not heard back (been a month) and the previous claim there is need for discussion and I've not had a reply.",5,Awesome!

You provided a customized option for my unique situation that made my travel preparations so much simpler.  I REALLY appreciate the fact that Heymondo has people like yourself to deal with travellers like me!!!I also was impressed that the company proactively provides a COVID coverage document, as the country I‚Äôm moving to requires that travellers prove they are covered for COVID related health issues while there.If only you could also take care of changing my hotel dates in Thailand!

No claims and no history to rate, but good start.",5,Quick and efficient response!
Donald Scott Martin,CA,2021-11-29T18:45:29.000Z,"In the end, everything worked out well, so I am grateful for the end result. HOWEVER, when dealing with the insurance provider called Axa, and you are in the middle of an emergency, and it takes 25 hours to get confirmation of your coverage, (i.e. after you have already been admitted into the hospital and you have no choice, and you are totally stressed about how you're going to pay if they deny your coverage), and no one calls you and no one answers your e-mails, and the app doesn't allow you to send your number to an Axa agent for them to call you, you can only call them, which is not always possible, it can get pretty frustrating.And when you get no guarantees of coverage from Axa, only a strange e-mail talking about ""pre-existing diseases"", when you are in the hospital due to an injury from a fall, it is all pretty aggravating and stressful Even the hospital said, ""Ohhh, yeah Axa is REALLY slow.""The agent I was speaking to at Hey Mondo, Vanessa, was really great, but they have nothing to do with any of the decisions or the time it takes for the actual insurance company to do anything. Axa was very disappointing. In the end, they took care of everything, so I am pleased about that, but the stress was ridiculous.Hey Mondo should work with a more reliable insurance company or they will lose clients, ultimately. No one needs this kind of stress in a medical crisis, let alone a life or death situation. Hey Mondo did well, Axa was a real nightmare to deal with. I think I was just lucky that they couldn't deny my claim.One thing about Hey Mondo, though. I never received an e-mail with confirmation of my policy purchase. I searched for it when I needed to get my policy number, but they had never sent anything! And strangely, they also never sent anything saying my policy was about to expire and did I want to renew it. I only noticed it was due to expire THAT DAY because I went searching for the information because I needed to open a case file. And even while talking to them about opening a case file, no one noticed it was due to expire in 6 hours!!! It was me that said, ""Wait, is this going to expire today??!!"" I was just super lucky that I noticed! I wasn't too impressed with that.",5,Very good service

During office hours Giuseppe responds very promptly on the app, and is willing to give a telephone call to explain things.  The other feature that I like is that it states very clearly on the policy certificate that the policy covers covid-19 infection, which is really great for travelling to Thailand where immigration wants to see clearly that the traveller is covered for this.  On the app it has a 24 hour Heymondo Medical Chat feature and 24 hour Travel Assistant, both of which I haven't used, but, judging from the prompt replies received on the customer service feature, should be good. Heymondo also offers flexibility with the start date of the policy if travel plans should change.  Thoroughly recommend Heymondo and will definitely use again!!",5,Incredibly easy to use.

I can tell you that the Heymondo application was easy to fill and the policy easy to purchase.Some notes if you need to file a claim. 1. Keep your boarding pass and any and all flight documentation. Hard copies that is. 2. Medical visit. Make sure you get the full medical records and diagnosis from your visit whether hospital or doctor. 3. If you paid the claim for your group, paid for the hospital/medical  bill, you will need to get the person being treated to release the claim to you.The Heymondo rep mid claim came in to assist which helped.  ...AXA was the carrier for this particular claim by the way.The original review is still below for perusal.The process is horrible and tedious. I purchased a policy, actually three, for our group of around 50 plus people. One person got sick. Placed a claim and 3 months later, still being asked for paperwork. I do not recommend this company for groups. If you are a family, go ahead.. anything other than that... not worth it. GO to Allianz.. they are easier and more compliant.",5,Easy process

Rita Gava,US,2021-09-11T18:42:08.000Z,"Tried to buy travel insurance. The policy treated my infant twins as adults and charged us x3 when most insurance have cheaper rates for infants. We tried to contact the customer service via WhatsApp with a list of 8 questions. They responded that someone would call us. After 3 days, nothing. So we sent the same WhatsApp chat the same list of questions thinking our questions had been overlooked. The response was the same, someone would contact us. And then a separate very rude message was sent after ""we already answered your questions twice"". To which we replied ""How and where did you respond"" and they didn't even bother giving us a response after. So yup, if this is the customer service at the Sales Stage, I cannot imagine what it would be at the Claims Stage. Also a lot of fine print including the policy not being effective until after 72 hours, etc. I would caution you to read your policy very very carefully.Finally, I went to insubuy.com with a Trustpilot of 4.9. It was really awesome. Someone walked us thru the whole buying process on WhatsApp and answered all 25 questions we had very clearly and helped us fill in each section clearly. Atlas by Tokio Marine was the best and was well reviewed for their claims process. I wouldn't bother with heymondo. How disappointing.Response to their reply: We did not receive any emails. I cannot begin to even tell you how rude their customer service was. All the emails we got were discount codes.",5,Easy to get coverage and explained very‚Ä¶

In my case, I made an error on my policy which needs correcting. The contact number of the Heymondo app is the medical number to call in the event of you needing assistance. It is not the administrative services offered by Heymondo. Since I called them, I got referred to an email address and a phone number, and have called several other numbers I obtained from Google, all unsuccessful!! call and no answer there including the the email address given by the medical department in Spain, my email is not going through. I am now forced to cancel this policy as I have already spend $$$$ phoning Spain just to try rectify my policy before I travel. Also I needed further info re my policy to finalize it.

Sandra crook,AU,2021-09-02T12:29:39.000Z,"I have been a returning customer to both Heymondo (and the underwriter AXA), as I appreciated the ease of use of the platform.Unfortunately, having filed for my first claim, I am shocked by the treatment and what is effectively false marketing on the website (intentionally opaque and not explaining what is covered or not). Please beware of the Covid19 coverage, it is useless. You will be better off not having any (unless required by countries you are travelling to).I took out the Heymondo policy to protect me during the sailing trip for two reasons: (1) activity cover and (2) Covid19 cover for non-refundable expenses. Before boarding the sailing boat, I have tested positive on Covid19, I had to cancel the trip and forced to quarantine in the hotel. I have been denied both reimbursement of the trip and extra expenses related to the quarantine stay on the pretext that my trip already started! That even though I would have been happy to only get reimbursed for the trip itself. I am shocked, after ruined time, never stepping on the boat, sitting between four walls in the hotel and 1 month of back and forth with Heymondo, I am down eur 80 which I paid for the Heymondo premium travel insurance!I strongly suggest you use different providers who are honest about their offering if even it comes at a bit of premium!REPLY TO BELOW:1) One thing is to have a nice interface, other is to actually be helpful with the claims. A reason I purchased the insurance was to cover a non-refundable trip (as per provided on the invoice). I am shocked that the insurance provider is passing on the responsibility to the trip operator!2) Heymondo does not offer any specific carve-out to their policy which would enable a trip start in a different country where you have to travel on personal expense. Indeed, most of the airlines, commercial hotels provide some rebooking flexibility (which means Heymondo passes on the responsibility). Also, most countries where you can travel are a low risk due to strict Covid 19 policy. Considering this, Heymondo is unlikely to need to settle any Covid19 related claim (except for medical hospitalisation - very unlikely unless you are in the high-risk group).3) I received a reply from the claim handling team (customer service never got back), bluntly denying any request to settle any claim besides medical expense. This means Heymondo seems to not even cover costs of self-isolation - meaning despite having an official document which disables any travel and mandates 10-day isolation - costs are coming out of my pocket on top of the cancelled trip and Heymondo insurance premium?! So if you hope to reduce any risk of Covid19, this policy is useless.",5,Sandys

Paul Hodgson,CA,2021-07-05T20:07:59.000Z,"Tried this insurance company for the first time.  I am a regular traveller for business. The country I travel to required covid coverage with an amount in USD. Could not find any company in Canada that would do that, and even received responses from sales associates showing they had no understanding the importance of following that country's directions. Bought a great policy from Heymondo. It had higher limits at a far better price than my past policies. Guisseppe was fantastic to deal with. I highly recommend this company. Will be using them in the future for all my travel insurance needs!",5,Easiest purchase ever!

I want to warn other customers that in order to get a quote, you have to give your email address, and then you get constant spam pushing you to make a purchase. The email I actually read had a TINY link to unsubscribe from the marketing emails that I only found after reading it several times. I'm hoping just replying to their email does the trick.I'm sure that when I asked for a quote, I ticked to something that agreed to this ""privacy"" policy. Lots of companies pull this. But signing me up for marketing emails without asking permission and *then* making it difficult to unsubscribe is crappy behaviour, and I want to warn anyone considering a purchase.",5,Immediate response

Fortunately, I haven‚Äôt had any serious issues during my travels, but I feel good knowing that Heymondo offers affordable policies that cover a variety of circumstances.

I love that I don‚Äôt have to make any advance payments for potential medical emergencies because Heymondo works that out with the hospital. The mobile app has been a great addition to the service, and customer support has always been courteous and helpful. You can even make a claim on the app. In my experience, Heymondo‚Äôs transparent, flexible policies give you more coverage for a lower price, so I don‚Äôt plan on switching my travel insurance anytime soon.",4,This is very good service
