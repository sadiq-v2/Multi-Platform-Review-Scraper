Scraper Project
A comprehensive project to automate the extraction and processing of reviews from multiple platforms, including Glassdoor and Trustpilot. The project employs different scraping techniques tailored to each platform:

Glassdoor: Reviews are scraped using Selenium for dynamic content handling. Data, including employee reviews, ratings, and review titles, is processed into a structured format and exported to an Excel file for analysis.
Trustpilot: Customer reviews are scraped using requests and BeautifulSoup for static content. The collected data, such as user details, ratings, locations, and reviews, is structured into a Pandas DataFrame and saved as a CSV file.
